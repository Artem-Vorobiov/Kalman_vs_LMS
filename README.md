# Introduction

In this assignment Kalman Filter was implemented on a raw data and prediction of KF would be avaluated.
Moreover, I want to apply Least Means Square to the same data and **compare the outputs of KF and LMS**.

**Table of contents:**

1. Kalman Filter
2. Tweak hyperparameters KF
3. Apply hyperparameters
4. LMS
5. Tweak hyperparameters LMS
6. KF vs LMS
7. Conclsuion
